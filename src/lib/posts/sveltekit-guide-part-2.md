Welcome back to the Sveltekit guide!
In this part, we'll be looking at the project structure and routing.
We'll also get a basic todo-list going, except we'll be doing it "the wrong way".
AKA the way that doesn't take advantage of Sveltekit's features.

## Getting on the same page

If you've followed the previous part of the guide, you can skip this section.
Else, you can clone the repository from [here](https://github.com/Suyashtnt/doen).
Use tag `part-1` to get the code from the previous part.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Suyashtnt/doen
cd doen
git checkout part-1
```

## Project structure

The project structure is _fairly_ simple in a sveltekit app.
There are only a few files you usually have to worry about when you're starting out.

I'll be talking about the following below:

```

### Svelte.config.js

This is the config file for Svelte and Sveltekit.
This file usually tells sveltekit where your files are,
and what to do with them.

It sets up _preprocessors_, which can transform your code
before it's compiled (e.g. compile typescript to javascript).
In doen, we tell svelte to use vite to process our files,
transforming typescript to javascript, and process our css
through lightningcss. We also tell it to use Melt-ui's preprocessor,
which is a custom preprocessor that allows us to remove a lot of boilerplate
melt-ui code usually creates.

Another thing it does is set up _adapters_. This is a sveltekit specific feature.
It allows you to deploy your app to different platforms
(Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, etc.) by compiling your already compiled code
to a format that the platform understands. Sveltekit by default comes with a
smart auto adapter, which can detect which platform you're deploying to,
and use the appropriate adapter.
In doen, we're using this auto-adapter so we don't have to
worry about it.

See [Part 1](/posts/sveltekit-guide-part-1#sveltekit) for more info.

### Vite.config.js

This is the config file for vite, which is the bundler that sveltekit uses.

<Note>
In the future, sveltekit will be using Turbopack instead of vite.
This will most likely be in svelte 5, so if you are reading this in the future,
check the new guide if it exists.
</Note>

This file is pretty simple. It just configures vite to use LightningCSS over
postcss, and to use the UnoCSS and sveltekit plugins. The UnoCSS plugin is
svelte's specific plugin for UnoCSS, which does a bunch of fancy stuff to get
its atomic css engine working inside of svelte components. The sveltekit plugin
is a plugin that allows vite to work with sveltekit, and does basically everything
that sveltekit needs to work.

You will also see a `test` config object, which is for vitest.
Vitest is an absurdly fast testing framework for any vite project,
and works with Svelte. We'll be using it later on for testing our app.

See [Part 1](/posts/sveltekit-guide-part-1#vite-config) for more info.

### Package.json

A regular nodejs package.json file. Nothing special here.
It tells pnpm what packages to install and what your scripts are.
It also has `type` set to `module`, which tells nodejs to use es modules
over commonjs modules. This is a requirement for sveltekit to work, and
recommended in any modern nodejs project.

### eslint.config.js

Our ESLint config. See [Part 1](/posts/sveltekit-guide-part-1#eslint) for how it
works.

### The `static` folder

This is where all your static files go. This includes images, fonts, etc.
They will be directly mapped to the root of your site.
E.g. if you have `static/favicon.png`, it will be available at `https://your-site.com/favicon.png`.

### The `src` folder

This is where all app-specific code goes. It's the main folder of our project.
It handles all the routing, and contains all the components, pages, and pretty
much any business logic you require for your app.

#### The `src/lib` folder

This folder contains any code that is not specific to routing
or any other part of the app. It contains code that can be used anywhere*

<Note>
*If you have `lib/server`, any code in there will only be available on the server.
Similarly, if you have `lib/client`,
any code in there will only be available on the client.
</Note>

This folder is also where you put shared components, like a button component
thats used in multiple places. You don't usually put page-specific components
in here, as they are only used in one place. The routes folder can actually
contain components as well, which will be described down below.

#### The `src/routes` folder

Welcome to the most confusing part of sveltekit for beginners: _folder_ based routing.
If you're coming from other meta-frameworks, you may know file-based routing,
where each file it its own route. `pages/index.tsx` is the root route,
`pages/about.tsx` is `/about`, etc.

Sveltekit _used_ to have this, but it was replace with folder-based routing.
This is where each folder is a route, and there are special files
that are used to determine what to do with the folder. In sveltekit,
these files are prefixed with a `+`. E.g. `+page.svelte`. For now,
I'll be explaining `+page.svelte` and `+layout.svelte`. When we use other
files in future posts, I'll explain them then.

##### `+page.svelte` (Go here for a barebones todo list app!)

Lets, start with the basics. The root `routes` folder is your root route (`/`).
Sveltekits folder based routing works off files that begin with a `+`.
The most common one is `+page.svelte`, which is used to render a page.
This is your markup file, which contains your svelte code for that page.
This is where you work on the contents of a page. `src/routes/+page.svelte`
will be rendered at `/`, `src/routes/about/+page.svelte` will be rendered at `/about`,
and so on.

In fact, let's create a basic todo list app using the root `+page.svelte` file!

```svelte
<!-- change lang="js" to lang="ts". Limitation of my blog setup -->
<script lang="js">
    import { browser } from "$app/environment";
    import { flip } from 'svelte/animate'

    // Interface for a todo. This is effectively the data model
    interface Todo {
        done: boolean
        id: string
        text: string
    }

    // The internal todo list
    let todos: Todo[] = []

    const addTodo = (text: string) => {
        // in order to get svelte to update the list,
        // we need to reassign the todos variable
        todos = [
            ...todos,
            {
                done: false,
                id: createUniqueId(),
                text,
            },
        ]
    }

    const removeTodo = (id: string) => {
        // If we want to remove a todo, just filter it out
        todos = todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id)
    }

    // while we could just use window.crypto.randomUUID() directly,
    // it may lead to collisions. So we'll just recursively call
    // the function until we get a unique id.
    //
    // Fun fact: This has a time complexity of O(Infinity) in the worst case,
    // Since we could theoretically get an infinite amount of collisions.
    const createUniqueId = () => {
        let id = window.crypto.randomUUID()

        const todoExists = todos.find(todo => todo.id === id)
        if (todoExists) {
            id = createUniqueId()
        }

        return id
    }

    // since sveltekit does SSR, we need to check if we're in the browser
    // before accessing browser APIs
    if (browser) {
        // since we want to sync the todo list between sessions,
        // we'll use localStorage to get the todos
        const rawTodos = localStorage.getItem('todos')

        if (rawTodos) {
            todos = JSON.parse(rawTodos)
        }
    }

    // whenever `todos` changes, we'll update localStorage with the new todos
    $: if (browser) {
        localStorage.setItem('todos', JSON.stringify(todos))
    }

    // temporarily store the new todo
    let newTodo = ''

    // should we show done todos?
    let showDone = true

    // todo list shown in the UI
    // if we want to show done todos, we'll just use the todos array
    // else, we'll filter out the done todos
    $: todoList = showDone ? todos : todos.filter(todo => !todo.done)

so I can improve this guide.

##### `+layout.svelte`

Svelte has the concept of layouts, which are basically wrappers
around pages. The neat thing about layouts is that they can be nested.
This allows for some incredibly powerful stuff, like having a
layout for your entire app, and then in the `/settings` route
having a layout for the settings page, so e.g. the sidebar is
shared between the settings pages.

Let's create a layout for our app:

```svelte
<!-- Lets keep the default styling across pages -->
<svelte:head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@1/css/pico.min.css">
</svelte:head>

<!-- Lets also keep the header-->
<header>
    <hgroup class="text-center">
        <h1>Doen</h1>
        <h2>Your next todo list</h2>
    </hgroup>
</header>

<main class="mx-4">
    <!-- The slot component is where the inner html will be inserted -->
    <slot />
</main>
```

... and update our `+page.svelte` file:

```svelte
<script lang="js">
    // script tag stays the same
</script>

<!--
    since the layout wraps this page,
    we don't have to wrap the page in <main> nor include the <header>
-->

<div class="flex flex-row gap-4 mb-4">
    <h3 class="my-auto">Todos</h3>
    <div class="flex gap-4 items-center">
        <label for="show-done">Show done</label>
        <input
            type="checkbox"
            bind:checked={showDone}
            id="show-done"
        >
    </div>
</div>

<ul class="flex flex-col">
    <!-- (todo.id) makes sure that svelte properly diffs the list -->
    {#each todoList as todo (todo.id)}
        <!-- animate:flip applies a FLIP animation to the list item -->
        <!-- This means that when the item moves, it animates smoothly across the list -->
        <li class="grid grid-cols-6 gap-4" animate:flip={{ duration: 150 }}>
            <!-- The first way of applying a class based on a variable: inline JS -->
            <input
                type="text"
                bind:value={todo.text}
                class="col-span-4 {todo.done ? 'bg-green-500/40' : ''}"
            >
            <!-- The second way of applying a class based on a variable: the class directive -->
            <!-- class:name={boolean}. If true, the class is added -->
            <button
                on:click={() => todo.done = !todo.done}
                class:bg-red-500={todo.done}
                class:bg-blue-500={!todo.done}
            >
                {#if todo.done}
                    Unmark
                {:else}
                    Mark Done
                {/if}
            </button>
            <button on:click={() => removeTodo(todo.id)}>Remove</button>
        </li>
    {/each}
</ul>

<form
    on:submit|preventDefault={() => addTodo(newTodo)}
    class="grid grid-cols-7 gap-4"
>
    <input
        type="text"
        bind:value={newTodo}
        placeholder="What needs to be done?"
        class="col-span-6"
    >
    <button type="submit">Add</button>
</form>
```

Neat!

#### The `src/app.d.ts` file

This is a typescript-specific file that declares extra types for the app.
This is where you can declare types for e.g. locals,
which are variables shared between a specific server and client connection.

#### The `src/app.html` file

This is the bare bones html file that sveltekit uses to render your app.
It's pretty simple, and you can add whatever you want to it that will be
rendered on every page. It's effectively a lightweight `/routes/+layout.svelte`,
except even it can't be affected by errors.

#### The `src/hooks.server.ts` file

This is where you can put server-side hooks for your app. These
run on every request, and can be used to e.g. log requests, setup
database connections, etc.

## Conclusion

That's it for this part of the guide! While also fairly boring,
we now have a basic understanding of the project structure and routing,
along with a basic todo list app. However, this todo list app is
not very, well, sveltekit-y. In the next part of the guide, we'll
be setting up a database via drizzle, and using `+page.server.ts` to fetch
the todos from the database.
