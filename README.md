# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## TODO LIST

TODO: add <https://github.com/rodneylab/sveltekit-components> for images since it seems to be far better code than mine

## Developing

Once you've cloned the website and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
